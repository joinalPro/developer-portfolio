            <p>It's slower my life and I am the most lazy person in this world who spent last few years without any work
                and
                living under the proverty line. It's shame that I have created my future in poor. Now, I am doing the
                exercise and working 6 hours daily to learn web Development. It's fixed time and I don't do anything
                else in
                this time. Keep practicing.
