            <p>It's slower my life and I am the most lazy person in this world who spent last few years without any work
                and
                living under the proverty line. It's shame that I have created my future in poor. Now, I am doing the
                exercise and working 6 hours daily to learn web Development. It's fixed time and I don't do anything
                else in
                this time. Keep practicing.
            </p>

                min for a new habit after 40 days you will see that you are working automatically. habit need practice
                and action should be in the fixed time. </p>
